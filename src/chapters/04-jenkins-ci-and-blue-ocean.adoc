= Jenkins, CI and Blue Ocean

== Jenkins

image::{imagedir}/jenkins_logo.png[height="200"]

* Task orchestrator
* Open-Source software written in Java
* One of the first and most popular Continous Integration Engine
* Plugin based

== Continuous Integration (CI)

image::{imagedir}/fail-fast-continuous-integration.png[height=200]

* Each code integration is validated by an *automated build*
* Code is integrated *often*, at least daily, to be a non-event
* Feedback loop to close the continous cycle

== DevOps: Software as a "Supply Chain"

== The Pipeline

image::{imagedir}/pipeline.png[height=600]

== Jenkins Pipelines

image::{imagedir}/pipeline.jpg[height=200]

* A tool to express your software pipeline with a DSL
* Defined into a text file: `Jenkinsfile`
* "Pipeline-as-code": stored into your SCM
* != "Job DSL" (different areas)

== Benefits of Jenkins Pipelines

* Follows from your code workflows: branches, pull request,
code review, even trunk-based
* Reduces the number of jobs
* A single execution ("build") can run on multiple machines
* Durable: survives a Jenkins restart

== Blue Ocean

* A new developer experience for using Jenkins
* A modern GUI written in React,
in parallel of the "Classic UI"
* Pipeline-centric
* Install it with a plugin

== Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor

* Provides a Pipeline's graphical editor in Blue Ocean,
with full round trip with SCM:
** Scaffold your Pipeline, Save it, Execute it.
* Supports existing Declarative Pipeline,
as starting from scratch
* Requires a compatible SCM (Git over SSH, Github, BitBucket, etc.)

// == Declarative or Scripted Pipelines ?
//
// * *Declarative*
// ** Syntaxe par défaut
// ** S'utilise avec Blue Ocean
// * Scripted
// ** Syntaxe originale (~3 ans)
// ** "Great Power == Great Responsibility"
// ** À utiliser lorsque le Déclaratif commence à être *bizarre*
